 <!-- The prefix to be used to create the beginning of the customer
 code. This can be a constant for all customers created from a
 single application or can be derived from the customer name.
 Customer codes have a maximum of 10 characters so the maximum
 length of the prefix is 10 less the number of digits that will
 be added to make the code unique. -->

 <!-- The number of digits that should be added to the prefix to make
 the code unique. Numbers are signed sequentially to each distinct
 prefix, so if the value for this element is 4 and the prefix is
 OPT then the first code would be OPT0001, the second would be
 OPT0002 and so on. Therefore the number of digits required should
 be based on the likely maximum number of customers that will have
 the same prefix. -->
